# Minimal SearxNG configuration tailored for the MCP search module. The goal is
# to provide deterministic defaults that work in development and CI while
# keeping the list of enabled engines compliant with permissive licences.
#
# Keep the upstream defaults for every section but instruct SearxNG to retain
# only the engines listed below. This preserves core configuration (like
# `outgoing` and plugin definitions) while giving the search stack a predictable
# set of sources to work with.
