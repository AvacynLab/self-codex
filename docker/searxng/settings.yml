# Minimal SearxNG configuration tailored for the MCP search module. The goal is
# to provide deterministic defaults that work in development and CI while
# keeping the list of enabled engines compliant with permissive licences.
#
# Keep the upstream defaults for every section so the container benefits from
# future engine updates and security fixes. The curated engine list below
# overrides the settings we rely on without disabling the rest of the built-in
# catalogue; the search orchestrator targets only these engines through its
# environment configuration.

  # Use a deterministic but sufficiently long default secret so the container
  # boots without requiring manual overrides during local development. The
  # sample value below is 48 characters long, satisfying SearxNG's minimum
  # length requirements while remaining safe to replace in production via
  # environment overrides or Docker secrets.
