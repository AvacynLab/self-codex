# Recommendations

## P1 – Extend tool coverage
- Implement the remaining checklist phases (events capture, child orchestration, graph snapshots).

## P2 – Automate transport fallbacks
- Teach the campaign to attempt HTTP → STDIO → FS-Bridge so the artefacts reflect production deployments.

## P2 – Enrich reporting
- Aggregate per-phase metrics (p50/p99) and correlate findings with the recorded event streams for phase-01-introspection.
